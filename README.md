# Respiration_rate_detection_from_PPG
Traditional methods for measuring respiration rates rely on specific sensors, such as impedance pneumography, capnography and temperature sensors, to measure physiological signals associated with respiration. It requires manual parameter tuning and adaptation to specific patient populations. A neural network model known as a cycle generative adversarial network is used to reconstruct respiratory signals from raw PPG data and precisely calculate respiratory rates. PPG (Photoplethysmography) is a non-invasive technique that measures blood volume changes in peripheral blood vessels using light absorption.
